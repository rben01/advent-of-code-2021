The first thing we do is read the input file into a ndarray::Array2 of size (n_rows, n_cols), where a true value corresponds to a 1 character in the input, and a false to a 0. We also created a function that converts a binary vector, most significant digit first, to a (decimal) number (see the Setup section). For example, given 10011, we compute [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] .* [16, 8, 4, 2, 1] = [16, 0, 0, 2, 1], whose sum is 19.

The procedure to find the oxy_rate is as follows: Initialize the list of candidate values to the full list of rows in elems as defined above. With \\(k\\) ranging from the leftmost column index in elems to the rightmost column index (most significant digit to least): Successively narrow down the list of candidates by keeping only those remaining candidates whose \\(k\\)th digit is the most common \\(k\\)th digit of the remaining candidates, with a tie between 0 and 1 going to 1. For instance, when \\(k=5\\), then keep only the remaining candidates whose 5th digit is the most common 5th digit (0 or 1, ties going to 1) of all remaining candidates at that stage. Stop when only one candidate remains. (This is guaranteed to happen as long as the rows are all distinct.) The procedure for co2_rate is the same, except that the list of candidates is filtered down according to the least common digit in each position, with ties going to 0. include_source::mod.rs[tag=pt2]","title":"Day 3: Binary Diagnostic","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"day_03","url":"/day_03","titles":[{"text":"Setup","hash":"_setup","id":1},{"text":"Part 1","hash":"_part_1","id":2},{"text":"Part 2","hash":"_part_2","id":3}]},"4":{"id":4,"text":"link_day:4[] {link-sep} link_input:4[] The game is represented as a list of boards and a list of drawn numbers.

When a number is drawn, its Cartesian coordinates are used to update progress (below), and then the number is removed from the dictionary. The only reason drawn numbers are removed from a board’s dictionary is that Advent of Code asks for the sum of the board’s undrawn numbers to compute the answer, so we need to keep track of which numbers on a given board haven’t been drawn yet. Otherwise, we’d have had no reason to mutate the dictionary at all. progress, which stores for each row and column the count of numbers in that row/column have not yet been drawn. If one of those counts hit zero, then every number in that row/column has been drawn, and so the board has a \"Bingo\" (i.e., has won). The row and column indices have the same meaning as the Cartesian coordinates in the dictionary described above: if number 25 is drawn, and 25’s position on a particular board is (2, 3), then progress.rows[2] and progress.cols[3] each get decremented. Reading the input text into a game (numbers and boards) is in read_input_into_game, whose (not particularly interesting) implementation should serve as its docs. get_answer_from_final_game_state is just used to prove to Advent of Code that we actually got the solution. include_source::mod.rs[tag=setup] We simply draw numbers until a board has won, then get the answer. include_source::mod.rs[tag=pt1] This time, we keep track of all of the boards that haven’t won yet.

(Since the number of points is fixed, we will use “sum” and “mean” of the errors interchangeably, as they merely differ by a constant factor, the number of points.) A naive solution would iterate through all possibilities, but knowledge of statistics offers us a shortcut. In both parts, we aim to minimize an \\(l_p\\)-norm. Reading in the input: include_source::mod.rs[tag=setup] Part 1 asks us, in effect, to find the number \\(x\\) that minimizes the mean absolute deviation, or the \\(l_1\\)-norm of the error. The number that does this is simply the median of the dataset. (In this problem, the median may be a half-integer, but the solution has to be an integer, so we can just round the median down.) Proof: If you are not at the median and move towards it, you are moving toward at least as many data points as you are moving away from, which at best decreases the mean absolute deviation and at worst leaves it unchanged. include_source::mod.rs[tag=pt1] In Part 2, the cost associated with a distance of \\(n\\) is \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n k = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\).

(It would be a problem if \\(n\\) exceeded \\(n^2\\), as then it might dominate in the sum and we’d no longer be looking to minimize the mean of the \\(n^2\\).) This is the mean squared error (MSE, or \\(l_2\\)-norm of the error), and it is a well-known fact of statistics that the MSE is minimized by the arithmetic mean of the data. The only catch is that the arithmetic mean need not be an integer, but the solution to the problem must be. Naturally we simply try the two integers on either side of the arithmetic mean (which will both be the arithmetic mean itself if it’s an integer) and pick whichever of the two leads to a smaller error. This works because the error is concave up, i.e., a local minimum is the global minimum. include_source::mod.rs[tag=pt2]","title":"Day 7: The Treachery of Whales","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"day_07","url":"/day_07","titles":[{"text":"Setup","hash":"_setup","id":1},{"text":"Part 1","hash":"_part_1","id":2},{"text":"Part 2","hash":"_part_2","id":3}]},"8":{"id":8,"text":"link_day:8[] {link-sep} link_input:8[] What an interesting problem! We are asked to deduce the manner in which a computer has been incorrectly hooked up to a seven-segment display (7SD): We will use the following display schematic, with the segments labeled A–G: 0: 1: 2: 3: 4: AAAA AAAA AAAA B C C C C B C B C C C C B C DDDD DDDD DDDD E F F E F F E F F E F F GGGG GGGG GGGG 5: 6: 7: 8: 9: AAAA AAAA AAAA AAAA AAAA B B C B C B C B B C B C B C DDDD DDDD DDDD DDDD F E F F E F F F E F F E F F GGGG GGGG GGGG GGGG The computer sends a stream of digits that we see as various patterns of lit segments on the 7SD. The computer has the correct logic to display digits, but its wires to the 7SD got crossed during setup, so the digits it attempts to display end up looking like gibberish to us. But because the computer’s underlying logic still holds, we can still deduce things from its output. For instance, if it lights up only two segments, we know that it is trying to display a 1 (because 1 is the only digit made of exactly two segments), and so the two segments it lit up should be rewired to the two segments CF (although we still don’t know in which order). If it lights up five segments, then it could be trying to display either a 2 (ACDEG), 3 (ACDFG), or 5 (ABDFG). By observing the patterns it lights up, and using our knowledge of how the digits 0–9 should have been displayed, we can deduce the full wiring scheme and how the computer must be rewired to the display in order to function correctly. The only other wrinkle is we don’t even get to tell the computer which digits to attempt to display; that is entirely up to it. We simply receive a stream of some digits, and from that must deduce the wiring scheme. The Solution The strategy is as follows: for each garbled digit we see, record its pattern and the list of candidate digits (those having the same number of segments turned on). Then, by taking set differences and intersections between the patterns seen and their candidates, we can derive more specific information about the rewiring. For instance: Suppose the computer sends two digits and lights up ABD and AB. ABD only has one candidate, 7 (ACF), because only 7 has three segments turned on. AB only has one candidate, 1 (CF), because only 1 has two segments turned on. Then we take the difference of the displayed segments — ABD − AB = D — and all pairwise differences between their corresponding candidates (just one in this case) — ACF − CF = A — to deduce that D must be rewired to A. We continue this logic, subtracting (say) the map D ➜ A from other display-candidate pairs to narrow them down. We are done when we know the one segment that each segment needs to be rewired to. Suppose the computer sends ABCDE; its candidates would be 2 (ACDEG), 3 (ACDFG), and 5 (ABDFG). If it then sends DEF, its candidates would be just 7 (ACF). The intersection of the two sent digits is DE. Taking the pairwise intersections between the candidates, and keeping only those with the same length as DE, we see that the candidates for DE are AC and AF. Subtracting D ➜ A from this, we deduce that E must be mapped to either C or F. Subtracting D ➜ A and E ➜ C|F from DEF ➜ ACF, we see that F ➜ C|F as well. Continuing this way, we can eventually deduce all the mappings. First, we model the notion of a digit. include_source::mod.rs[tag=digit] The Algorithm We repeatedly take the intersection and set-differences between digits, getting a more and more refined mapping until finally we are left with a 1:1 mapping. include_source::mod.rs[tag=setup] include_source::mod.rs[tag=pt1] include_source::mod.rs[tag=pt2]","title":"Day 8: Seven Segment Search","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"day_08","url":"/day_08","titles":[{"text":"Setup","hash":"_setup","id":1},{"text":"Part 1","hash":"_part_1","id":2},{"text":"Part 2","hash":"_part_2","id":3}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"link_day:9[] {link-sep} link_input:9[] Nothing complicated here.

(Note that the problem has us exploring an underwater cave system, so the source code below refers to nodes as “caves”.) Nodes are classified as either “big” or “small”, depending on the case of their name in the input. A big node can be visited arbitrarily many times, whereas a small node can only be visited a limited number of times. (If two big nodes were adjacent, then there would be infinitely many paths through the graph since because we could just bounce back and forth between them forever.) First, we must build the graph. We ingest the list of edges into a dictionary mapping each node to the set of nodes reachable from it. After doing this we traverse the graph. We maintain a stack representing the current path; we push onto the stack from the choices in the current node’s entry in the dictionary, and when we’ve exhausted all of the edges available from the current node, we pop the current node. We don’t actually maintain a stack in the code; we merely use the call stack. include_source::mod.rs[tag=setup] In Part 1, we may only visit each small node at most once.

Specifically, we are given a map from pairs of characters to single characters. Each generation, each pair of characters in the original string is to have its entry in this map (if it exists) inserted between the two characters. This runs on a specified starting string for a specified number of generations, producing a final string. My initial attempt involved actually building the string at each stage. Unfortunately, because the string approximately doubles in length in each step, it’s computationally infeasible to generate the string the requested 40 generations out, nor would we be able to store it in memory (240 is around one trillion). The right way to do this problem is to maintain a tally of counts of each pair (c1, c2) of characters in the string. Each generation, we run through the pairs, and if the mapping contains a character c3 to insert, then we remove key (c1, c2) and assign its tally to keys (c1, c3) and (c3, c2). This doesn’t tell us what the resulting string is, but thankfully the problem doesn’t ask us about the string per se; it only asks for character counts within the string. To count the number of times a character c appears in the string, we simply note that it is counted twice, once for each pair it is the first character of and once for each pair it is the second character of. So we just add up the number of times we see it in a pair and then divide by 2, right? Wrong! The first (respectively, last) character of the string is actually only counted once because it is only the first (respectively, second) character of one pair of characters, not two. The way we model this is maintain a tally not just of character counts, but of the positions of those characters. Our tally now assigns counts to triples (c1, c2, pos0) where pos0 is one of “start”, “middle”, and “end”. When we insert c3 between c1 and c2, we obtain (c1, c3, pos1) and (c3, c2, pos2), where: pos1 is either “start” or “middle”; it is “start” if and only if pos0 was “start”, and pos2 is either “end” or “middle”; it is “end” if and only if pos0 was “end”. Now, only the characters occurring in the “middle” are double-counted, so the number of times a character appears in the final string is the number of times it occurred in a character pair in the “start” or “end” positions, plus half the number of times it occurred in a “middle” character pair. To make the counting easier when working with integers and floored division, we double the “start” and “end” character counts, add them to the “middle” character counts, and then halve everything at the end. As you might have guessed, my first attempt at this problem did not keep track of pairs’ positions and so was plagued by an off-by-one error which only arose for specific inputs. (I believe it had to do with whether the final string started and ended with the same character, but I didn’t bother generating test cases to check this.) My first submission was too large, so I subtracted 1 from it and re-submitted and got it correct.

This is a classic CS problem which can be solved with the A* Algorithm. My initial solution used a (max-) priority queue to choose the next node to examine, with priority equal to the (negative of the) total cost of the path up to that node. While this solution worked, it took an inordinate amount of time on the larger input, which was 500×500. (I suspect that this was due to the fact that the implementation of that priority queue uses a HashMap instead of a (perhaps) more optimal structure such as a BTreeMap. I also didn’t really feel like seeing if I could speed it up with a faster hasher. And I definitely didn’t want to implement my own priority queue with a BTreeMap instead.) Despite being theoretically suboptimal, my second solution performed much faster. This new solution was simply to maintain a grid of tentative costs to reach each number on the grid. This grid of tentative costs was initially set to u32::MAX, except for the top left corner which was set to 0. On each iteration, for each node \\(P\\) in the grid, we examine \\(P\\)’s four neighbors. If the cost to reach a neighbor through \\(P\\) is cheaper than the neighbor’s current tentative cost, we replace the latter cost with the former cost. We repeat this process until no modifications are made to any tentative cost, at which point the answer is simply the cost of reaching the bottom right corner. include_source::mod.rs[tag=setup] include_source::mod.rs[tag=pt1] Part 2 asked us not just to traverse the grid, but to construct a larger grid to use as our input, which was formed by concatenating modified copies of Part 1’s input.

It consisted of roughly three parts: Parse a hex string into a binary string by parsing each hex character into a quartet — trivial (Part 1) Parse this binary string into a tree of packets according to rules set out in the problem statement — “easy” in the sense that I wrote up an almost correct solution in no time at all. Very very hard in the sense that it required precise bookkeeping and it took forever for me to get it all exactly correct. But from a theoretical standpoint it wasn’t really that hard. (Part 2) Evaluate the packet tree as an expression tree (more or less like parsing S-expressions) — easy. The main function here is Binary::as_packets. There’s a lot to unpack here, but roughly the algorithm is as follows: Maintain a cursor into the original data Maintain a stack of parse states, which consist of: The depth in the parse tree The length of remaining data for this packet. Packets tell us how much data they expect; when there isn’t any left, we head back up a level in the tree. So we have to track how much of their data we’ve consumed so far. This “amount of data” quantity comes in two flavors: Number of bits that the children comprise Number of direct children, i.e., number of child packets One tricky bit is that packets share bits-remaining with their children. In other words, if a child consumes some bits from the input, so have all of its ancestors that count their data in bits. (Packets that are expecting a fixed number of child packets are unaffected when their descendants consume data.) In either case, if the current packet has no more data remaining — 0 bits or 0 child packets — continue on to the next parse state on the stack. Looking at the data beginning at the cursor, parse the stream into a single packet. Advance the cursor the number of bits this packet consumed. If this packet was an operator, increment the depth, as its children will follow. Otherwise the depth remains unchanged. Push a new parse state onto the stack, containing the incremented depth and the length of remaining data for this packet. If this packet was the last of its parent’s children, decrement the depth. include_source::mod.rs[tag=setup] Part 1 just asks us to compute some summary data of all the packets in the parse tree. As long as we have the right packets (regardless of their depths) we’ll get the right answer. include_source::mod.rs[tag=pt1] Part 2 asks us to actually evaluate the packet tree as a tree of an expressions, akin to S-expressions.

This problem was hard. After looking at the subreddit it looks like most people just brute forced it. That’s easy, but where’s the fun in that? Where possible, we want to solve these problems in the most computationally efficient manner possible. We are asked to find the initial \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-velocities that will land a projectile, fired from the origin, in a given rectangular region \\(R=[x_\\mathrm{min}, x_\\mathrm{max}]\\times[y_\\mathrm{min}, y_\\mathrm{max}]\\). In the \\(x\\)-direction, the projectile suffers from drag, so its \\(x\\)-velocity decreases by 1 each tick until it hits 0 (at which point it can’t slow down anymore). In the \\(y\\)-direction, the projectile is affected by gravity (but no drag (?)), so its \\(y\\)-velocity decreases by each tick, forever. All numbers — time, positions, and velocities — must be (not-necessarily-positive) integers. (And, naturally, time must be positive.) This is an important and helpful constraint on the values we can use. The solution below does not use brute force; it does not, for instance, try all \\(v_x\\)s between 0 and \\(R\\)'s right edge, or all \\(v_y\\)s between \\(-\\mathrm{abs}(v_\\mathrm{max})\\) and \\(\\mathrm{abs}(v_\\mathrm{max})\\). All potential times, positions, and speeds are derived mathematically. It has no problem running on a target area of x=1000000..1001000, y=-1000000..-1001000 (although this particular target area requires being able to take the integer square root of large numbers, which I did not implement myself). include_source::mod.rs[tag=setup_main] The Math Because \\(x\\) decreases by 1 each tick until it hits 0, and \\(y\\) decreases by 1 each tick forever, we have the following equations for the \\(x\\)- and \\(y\\)-coordinates at time \\(t\\) of a projectile fired with an initial velocity of \\( (v_x, v_y)\\). (Derivations are left to the reader, but a helpful fact is that \\(1+2+\\ldots+n = \\frac{1}{2}n(n+1)\\).) \\[ \\begin{align*} x(t, v_x) &= \\begin{cases} v_x t - \\frac{1}{2}t(t-1)&t \\le v_x\\\\ \\frac{1}{2}v_x(v_x+1)&t \\ge v_x \\end{cases}\\\\ y(t, v_y)&=v_y t - \\frac{1}{2}t(t-1) \\end{align*} \\] Note that even though the two definitions of \\(x\\) overlap at \\(t=v_x\\), they also coincide there, so it’s not a problem. Now, we must find the values of \\( (v_x,v_y)\\) that land the projectile in \\(R\\). To do this, we simply find the values of \\( (v_x,v_y)\\) that will land the projectile precisely at a point \\( (x,y)\\) in \\(R\\), for each \\( (x,y)\\in R\\). And to do this, we find the \\( (v_x,v_y)\\) that will land the projectile at \\( (x,y)\\) precisely at time \\(t\\), for each positive \\(t\\). To find the velocities that will land the projectile precisely at \\( (t,x,y)\\), we solve the above equations for \\(v_x\\) and \\(v_y\\). Finding \\(v_y\\) is simple: \\(v_y=\\frac{2y+t(t-1)}{2t}\\). For \\(v_x\\), it’s a bit more complicated, as we have two options: \\[ v_x=\\begin{cases} \\frac{2x+t(t-1)}{2t}&t\\le v_x\\\\ \\frac{-1\\pm\\sqrt{1+8x}}{2}&t\\ge v_x \\end{cases} \\] And as we said above, we need everything to be an integer, so we can either have no pairs of velocities that work, one pair, or two pairs. include_source::mod.rs[tag=velo_finder] Awesome. We have the 0, 1, or 2 velocities that will land the projectile at \\( (x, y)\\) at time \\(t\\). But how to find the \\(t\\)s for which the projectile can even land at \\( (x,y)\\)? We cannot enumerate all \\(t\\)s, as there are infinitely many positive integers. Could we perhaps keep firing it with a larger and larger \\(v_y\\) and hope that it would continue to land in \\(R\\) at some point in its trajectory? The answer is no: there are only finitely many values of \\(v_y\\) for which there exists a time \\(t\\) such that the projectile has a vertical position of \\(y\\) at \\(t\\). Let’s prove it, and let’s find them. Solving the equation \\(y=v_y t- \\frac{1}{2}t(t-1)\\) for \\(t\\), we find that: \\[t=\\frac{1}{2}\\left((2v_y+1)\\pm\\sqrt{(2v_y+1)^2-8y}\\right)\\] First and foremost, for this to be an integer, \\((2v_y+1)^2-8y\\) must be a perfect square. Letting \\( m^2 =(2v_y+1) ^ 2\\) and \\(n^2 = m^2 - 8y\\), we have \\(m^2 - n^2 = 8y\\), which factors into \\((m-n)(m+n)=8y\\). Since everything must be an integer, we can use the factor pairs of \\(8y\\) to find \\(m\\) and \\(n\\). If \\(8y=(m-n)(m+n)=k_1k_2\\), then \\(m=\\frac{1}{2}(k_1+k_2)\\). Hence, if \\(2v_y+1=\\frac{1}{2}(k_1+k_2)\\), then \\((2v_y+1)^2 - 8y\\) will indeed be a perfect square. Of course, we also need \\(\\frac{1}{2}(k_1+k_2)\\) to be an odd integer so that \\(v_y\\) will be an integer. Finally, we plug \\(v_y\\) into our equation for \\(t\\) and if we get an integer, we’ve got a match: if the projectile is fired with a \\(y\\)-velocity of \\(v_y\\), then it will hit the vertical position \\(y\\) precisely at \\(t\\). The astute reader will note that there every projectile with \\(v_y>0\\) hits \\(y=0\\) on the way down. Therefore we exclude \\(y=0\\) from consideration altogether; a problem that included \\(y=0\\) in \\(R\\) would have infinitely many answers or be impossible to solve. include_source::mod.rs[tag=time_finder] We are nearly there! To find whether, and how, the projectile can reach the point \\( (x,y)\\), we find: the set of pairs \\((t, v_y)\\) that give the projectile a vertical position of \\(y\\) at time \\(t\\), and for each of these pairs, we check that the projectile can indeed reach \\( (x,y)\\) at time \\(t\\) (we know it can reach \\(y\\), but can it reach \\(x\\)?) and find the velocities \\( (v_x,v_y)\\) that will achieve that, if possible. And we simply do this for every \\( (x,y)\\in R\\). include_source::mod.rs[tag=get_traj] Once we get all the trajectories, the actual answers we’re asked for are pretty simple. Part 1 asks us to find the maximum possible height that can be achieved by a projectile that reaches \\(R\\).

Rather than store the tree as an actual tree, which would be easy (maybe) but would suffer from poor cache locality, we store the nodes in a Vec and record the depth of each node. This makes traversing and manipulating the tree much easier than if they were stored in a “real” tree; the nodes to the left and right of index i are simply those at i-1 and i+1, respectively (if they exist). include_source::mod.rs[tag=snail_num] The operations are performed as follows: Exploding A pair is exploded by finding the first flat pair of depth at least four and storing the two values; the first is added to the node to the left and the second is added to the node to the right. The second element of the pair is then deleted. include_source::mod.rs[tag=explode] Splitting An element is split by simply dividing it by 2 twice, rounding down the first time and up the second time, and replacing the element with those two values. include_source::mod.rs[tag=split] Adding Two pairs are added by placing them in a containing pair. This is manifested as simply concatenating the two vectors and then incrementing all the depths. Notably, addition is not associative. include_source::mod.rs[tag=add] Finding Pairs in the Vector The only somewhat tricky part is determining the tree structure from the vector of depths. A singleton is returned as an Err containing its value. A “flat” pair (a pair whose elements are both atomic) appears as two consecutive elements of the same depth. Non-flat pairs can be found by traversing the nodes from left to right, maintaining a stack of node depths, and, whenever the top two elements of the stack have the same depth \\(d\\), collapsing them into a single element with a depth of \\(d-1\\). When a pair with elements of depth 1 is found, we have split the tree into its two top-level pairs. If desired, we can then recurse on these to split the descendants into deeper pairs. include_source::mod.rs[tag=pair] Magnitude of a Pair Self explanatory: include_source::mod.rs[tag=magnitude] Functions listed above are omitted here. include_source::mod.rs[tags=setup;!*] Part 1 simply asks to perform addition on the input numbers. include_source::mod.rs[tag=pt1] Part 2 asks to find the maximum pairwise sum of the input numbers. include_source::mod.rs[tag=pt2]","title":"Day 18: Snailfish","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"day_18","url":"/day_18","titles":[{"text":"Setup","hash":"_setup","id":1},{"text":"Part 1","hash":"_part_1","id":2},{"text":"Part 2","hash":"_part_2","id":3}]},"19":{"id":19,"text":"link_day:19[] {link-sep} link_input:19[] This problem asks us to essentially solve a 3D jigsaw puzzle; we are given “pieces” (scanners) and need to find how they fit together by looking at their “edges” (beacons). As in an ordinary puzzle, we might need to rotate pieces to get them to mesh. To solve this, we simply try every solution: we start with Scanner #1 and try to adjoin each other scanner to it. Once we find a scanner that works, we go back to step 1 and try to adjoin a new scanner to the two-scanner union, and when we’ve done that we try to adjoin a new scanner to the three-scanner union, etc. If at any point we can’t fit a new scanner onto the existing scanners, we backtrack, removing scanners so that we can add them in a different way. We’re done when all scanners have been adjoined. Technically there is a wrinkle that this solution ignores: it is not sufficient for scanners to merely fit together, i.e., to have overlapping beacons; additionally, each of the scanners in an adjoined pair must not have any beacons in the shared region that the other scanner in the pair does not have. In other words, they must agree on all, not just some, of the beacons in the region where they intersect. We ignore this wrinkle altogether; thankfully the authors were kind enough to give us input where this doesn’t matter. Because this “puzzle” is three-dimensional, there are 24 ways to orient a piece with respect to another (six faces can be “up”, and then there are four ways to rotate about the up-axis). In the code, one of these 24 orientations is referred to as a Swivel. For each orientation, we find all translations that cause the pieces to fit together; these are Translations. (A Swivel and a Translation together form a Transform.) Then we rinse and repeat with the next piece. To actually do the math, we simply use matrix multiplication. As always, the matrix \\(T\\) that performs a given transformation is the matrix whose columns are \\(T(e_1), \\ldots, T(e_n) \\) where \\(e_1,\\ldots,e_n\\) are the basis vectors. The function that does the heavy lifting here is Scanner::merge_all, which simply starts with the first provided scanner and then repeatedly tries to form larger and larger unions by merging the other scanners with the existing union. It stops when it first successfully merges all scanners together. include_source::mod.rs[tag=setup] Part 1 asks us to simply count the distinct beacons after the scanners have all been merged. Below, scanner is obtained from let (transforms, scanner) = Scanner::merge_all(scanners).unwrap();. include_source::mod.rs[tag=pt1] Part 2 asks us to find the maximum Manhattan distance between scanners. To do this, we have to track the transformation of each scanner in the successful merge; we then read the pairwise Manhattan distances from each scanner’s transformation’s translation. include_source::mod.rs[tag=pt2]","title":"Day 19: Beacon Scanner","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"day_19","url":"/day_19","titles":[{"text":"Setup","hash":"_setup","id":1},{"text":"Part 1","hash":"_part_1","id":2},{"text":"Part 2","hash":"_part_2","id":3}]},"20":{"id":20,"text":"link_day:20[] {link-sep} link_input:20[] This problem asks us to manipulate an infinitely large binary array, whose elements we’ll refer to as pixels. Only a finite interior portion of the array has “actual” content, which we store in a 2D array. The infinite surrounding (exterior) area is either all-on or all-off, which we store in a single variable separate from the interior portion of the array. Transforming a pixel requires knowing the state of each of the eight pixels it is adjacent to. The rules are the same for each pixel, but how they are applied in practice depends on whether the pixel is interior or exterior. If a given pixel is only adjacent to other interior pixels, we just look at look at those eight surrounding interior pixels. If a pixel is adjacent to both interior and exterior pixels, then we look at both the array of interior pixels and the state of the exterior pixels. The exterior pixels that are adjacent to interior pixels become interior themselves as part of this update, as they no longer necessarily share their state with the rest of the monolithic exterior. Thus the interior portion grows each step. All other pixels are exterior and are surrounded only by other exterior pixels; therefore they are all updated in the same manner. Since the exterior starts out as all-off, it remains either all-on or all-off for the duration of the problem. include_source::mod.rs[tag=setup] Parts 1 and 2 are nearly identical; they both ask to count the number of “on” pixels in the image resulting after \\(k\\) updates, where Part 1 has \\(k=2\\) and Part 2 has \\(k=50\\).

In this game, a move consists of rolling a die three times, adding up the rolled numbers, and then moving around the board based on the sum. In Part 1 we merely need to simulate this game for a deterministic die; this is so simple it’s not worth discussing. In Part 2 we need to count how many times each player wins across every possible sequence of die rolls. (Thankfully, the die in Part 2 only has three sides.) My first attempt at this actually went through every possible sequence. With a three-sided die, and games ranging in length from (say) 50 to 100 rolls, this was clearly computationally infeasible. To improve upon this, we note that while there are \\(3^3=27\\) ways to roll a three-sided die three times, there are only seven possible outcomes: the numbers 3 through 9. By precomputing the number of ways these sums can be rolled each turn, and then weighting each outcome by the number of ways it can be rolled, we cut down the base of the exponent by a factor of \\(\\frac{27}{7}\\), bringing the problem well into the realm of what is computationally feasible. include_source::mod.rs[tag=setup] include_source::mod.rs[tag=pt1] include_source::mod.rs[tag=pt2]","title":"Day 21: Dirac Dice","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"day_21","url":"/day_21","titles":[{"text":"Setup","hash":"_setup","id":1},{"text":"Part 1","hash":"_part_1","id":2},{"text":"Part 2","hash":"_part_2","id":3}]},"22":{"id":22,"text":"link_day:22[] {link-sep} link_input:22[] This problem asks us to find the \\(1\\times1\\times1\\) cubes — “small cubes” — in 3D space that remain after sequentially turning on and turning off the small cubes contained in a sequence of upright 3D rectangular prisms with integer coordinates; we’ll refer to these prisms as “boxes”. We record which small cubes remain after each operation as a list of boxes containing those cubes; the question is then how to record the boxes that result after performing the sequence of additions and subtractions between boxes. In other words, if at stage \\(k\\) the “on” cubes are contained in boxes \\(B_1,\\ldots,B_n\\), and we switch off the small cubes in \\(B_{n+1}\\), what set of boxes now contains the remaining “on” cubes? For simplicity, we’ll refer to the process of turning on the small cubes in a box \\(B\\) as “adding” \\(B\\), and turning off the cubes in \\(B\\) as “subtracting” \\(B\\). To subtract a single box \\(B_2\\) from another box \\(B_1\\), we first note that we only need to subtract the intersection \\(B_3\\coloneqq B_1\\cap B_2\\) of the two boxes from \\(B_1\\). Then, to subtract \\(B_3\\) from \\(B_1\\), we note that each maximal set of parallel edges of \\(B_3\\) divides the corresponding axis of \\(B_1\\) into three (potentially empty) regions: the parts before, between, and after their endpoints. For instance, if \\(B_3\\) has edge \\( ( (x_1,y,z) , (x_2,y,z) )\\) with \\(x_1<x_2\\), then this edge divides \\(B\\) into three portions along the \\(x\\)-axis: the parts less than \\(x_1\\), between \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), and greater than \\(x_2\\). Since each of the three axes is split into three regions by the subtraction, \\(B_3\\) ultimately divides \\(B_1\\) into 27 smaller (but not necessarily “small”) boxes, exactly one of which is \\(B_3\\) itself. Hence \\(B_1-B_2\\) is just the list containing the other 26 boxes. To subtract a single cube from the list of cubes \\(B_1,\\ldots,B_n\\), we simply subtract it from each \\(B_i\\) in turn, then collect all the resulting smaller boxes into a single list. Hence, to improve performance, after each subtraction, we (greedily) recombine the 26 smaller boxes into as few larger boxes as possible; otherwise the list of boxes to subtract from would grow without bound. To recombine boxes, we simply take two boxes that have a face in common and write them as the union, and repeat this until no two boxes share a face. (Fewer boxes could probably be obtained with some sort of dynamic programming algorithm; this wasn’t deemed worth it.) include_source::mod.rs[tag=setup] Parts 1 and 2 ask us to perform the same sequence of operations. In Part 1 this sequence occurs is in a bounded space (presumably in a space small enough for it to have been feasible to store each small cube individually).

Each agent has a different cost associated with movement. This is another classic graph exploration problem solvable with a priority queue; unfortunately a naive solution is computationally infeasible. The crux of solving this problem efficiently is realizing that there are many, many equivalent sequences of moves; rather than consider them all, we only consider those comprised of the fewest atomic moves in which, roughly speaking, a single amphipod moves as far as possible. Some examples of simplifications to the ruleset: It makes no sense to consider an amphipod moving within its initial room unless that move takes it out of the room; a disjoint sequence of moves inside the room can be reordered into a single move from the starting point to the room’s doorway. No amphipod should ever move deeper into its initial room; it should only ever move toward the doorway, and then from the doorway to some spot in the hallway. The rules state that an amphipod can only its final side room when it is already possible to move into the last unoccupied square in that room. Therefore, when an amphipod currently in the hallway moves move from the hallway into its final side room, it should move as far into that side room as possible. Considering all simplifications and move reorderings, there are in fact only a handful of moves worth considering at each stage: An amphipod at its starting point in some side room can move to somewhere in the hallway as long as that starting point isn’t also its final destination. As long as any amphipod can move to its final spot in its final side room, it should move there on this move. In other words, no amphipod should move while another amphipod can move to its final destination, as this move would be a needless entry in the priority queue. (If two amphipods can both move to their final side rooms, pick one for this turn arbitrarily.) An amphipod that is currently in its final position — as far to the back in its side room as it can go, with no other-kinded amphipods between it and the back of its room — should not move at all. This keeps the number of moves considered tiny, making the search for the cheapest path through the graph run very quickly. Most of the setup is just creating an array wrapper type that is indexable by amphipods. (Thanks to Rust’s const generics, this type is statically sized.) This is achieved by simply assigning an integer from 0 to N_AMPHIPODS-1 to each amphipod and using that as the index. Because the arrays are static, we get an additional performance boost compared to using a heap-allocated Vec. (Due to laziness, I created two separate copies of the input, rather than perform the modification to the input for Part 2 as described in the problem statement.) include_source::mod.rs[tag=amphipods] The Algorithm include_source::mod.rs[tag=solve] include_source::mod.rs[tags=pt1;pt2]","title":"Day 23: Amphipod","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"day_23","url":"/day_23","titles":[{"text":"Setup","hash":"_setup","id":1},{"text":"Parts 1 and 2","hash":"_parts_1_and_2","id":2}]},"24":{"id":24,"text":"link_day:24[] {link-sep} link_input:24[] This problem asks us to do two things: Implement a simple processor, with four registers W, X, Y, and Z all initialized to 0, that accepts a program to run. Find the inputs to this program that will lead to the processor’s Z register containing 0 when its input has been entirely consumed, which we’ll refer to as “acceptable inputs”. The specific program that this problem gives us reads in 14 digits of input, so it looks something like this: read 1st digit of input into W register read 2nd digit of input into W register read 3rd digit of input into W register …​ read 14th digit of input into W register check if register Z is 0 We will refer to the list of instructions from one read instruction up to, but excluding, the next read instruction — such as the instructions contained in lines 1 and 2 of the above text — as an “instruction block”. Note that while the inputs to the program are digits in the range [1, 9], the registers can contain arbitrary integers. For instance the program could read 8 into W, copy W to X, read 9 into W, multiply W and X, and write the result to Z; then Z would have a value of 72. include_source::mod.rs[tag=setup] The Algorithm A naive solution that ran the program on every every possibility from 1014 to 1015−1 would need to check 9×1014 possibilities, which would be computationally infeasible. (Trust me, I tried. Did not get very far before searching for a better way.) Instead, we use the fact that the set of register values achievable by instruction block k is actually quite small (compared to 9×1014). The algorithm is as follows: Before reading any input, the Z register has an initial value of z0 = 0. Phase 1: We find the set of values z1 of the Z register after instruction block 1 reads in a digit. For each z1, we find the set of values z2 of the Z register after instruction block 2 reads in a digit, and record for each z2 which values of z1 led to it. For each z2, we find the set of values z3 of the Z register after instruction block 3 reads in a digit, and record for each z3 which values of z2 led to it. This continues until we reach the end, at which point we will have a massive number of z14s linked to their preceding z13s, each of which is linked to its preceding z12s, each of which is linked to its preceding z11s, etc., going all the way back to the z1s, which point to z0 = 0. Phase 2: But we know we’re only concerned with inputs that lead to a final value of z14 = 0. So keep only those z13s that led to z14 = 0. Then keep only those z12s that led to those z13s. Then keep only those z11s that to those z12s. Repeat, going all the way back to find only those z1s that led to those z2s. This produces a diamond-shaped graph, which starts out small at z0 = 0, fans out in the middle, and then shrinks again as it approaches z14 = 0. Phase 3: Now that we have this graph, we’re almost done. A 14-digit input that causes the Z register’s final value to be 0 can be found by finding sequences of digits that take us all the way through the graph from left to right. So, if we’ve read in, say, 12345, and digit 6 does not lead to a permissible z6 value, then we know that 123456 is not the first six digits of any acceptable input. The problem asks us specifically for the largest and smallest acceptable inputs. To find these, we simply do a DFS on this graph, preferentially walking along edges formed by the largest digits, but backtracking to a smaller digit where necessary. To reduce code duplication, this DFS algorithm takes function parameters that give it the next digit to look at or tell it when to backtrack (since, for instance, it will need to backtrack when hitting d=1 when searching for the largest acceptable input but when d=9 for the smallest acceptable input). include_source::mod.rs[tag=algo] include_source::mod.rs[tags=pt1;pt2]","title":"Day 24: Arithmetic Logic Unit","component":"ROOT","version":"","name":"day_24","url":"/day_24","titles":[{"text":"Setup","hash":"_setup","id":1},{"text":"Parts 1 and 2","hash":"_parts_1_and_2","id":2}]},"25":{"id":25,"text":"link_day:25[] {link-sep} link_input:25[] Simple array manipulation.

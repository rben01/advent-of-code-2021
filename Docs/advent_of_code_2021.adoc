[.lead]
This doc has my solutions for the https://adventofcode.com/2021[2021 Advent of Code^].
It assumes some familiarity with https://julialang.org/[the Julia language^].
(For the most part, Julia looks kind of like a fusion of Python and Numpy, except it uses 1-based indexing and static functions instead of methods.)


[NOTE]
====
Advent of Code gives all participants the same problems, but gives different inputs to each participant.
Therefore, it makes little sense to give the actual numeric answers to problems here.
However, these solutions should work for any input/output pair provided by Advent of Code.

[WARNING]
====
This document has the solutions out in the open!
Don't read it if you're still working on Advent of Code.

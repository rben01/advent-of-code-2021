link_day:6[] {link-sep} link_input:6[]

At a high level, this problem requires modifying a map from ints to ints in a controlled fashion.
At a low level:

. This map's keys are actually the integers from 0 to 8 (inclusive), so it can just be stored in an array.
. The “controlled fashion” is merely shifting most values over.
In one case we have to also add to said values.

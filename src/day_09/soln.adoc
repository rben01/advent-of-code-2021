link_day:9[]

Nothing complicated here, especially because Julia makes working with arrays/matrices so easy.
We must do the following things with a 2D matrix whose entries are between 1 and 9 (inclusive).

. In {part-title} 1 we have to find the local minima of the matrix.
. In {part-title} 2 we have to find the matrix's maximal connected regions containing no 9s.
This is just a DFS through the matrix with a small amount of bookkeeping.

= Day 10: Syntax Scoring

link_day:10[] {link-sep} link_input:10[]

Pretty basic.
Parsing is done with a token stack; when we see paired braces at the top of the stack, we pop them both.
If we see mismatched braces, we immediately know we have a `Corrupted` token stream.
If we make it to the end of the input without match-and-popping everything — i.e., if the stack isn't empty at the end — then we have an `Incomplete` token stream.
